# CloudSim

## Introduction to CloudSim

CloudSim is a robot simulation system that is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. In CloudSim, an Unreal Engine Pixel Streaming application represents a virtual environment for executing the simulation. CloudSim allows running multiple independent simulation simtanously by creating multiple Pixel Streaming applications in the clusters. Each Pixel Streaming application can be considered as a simulation instance. User can create the simualtion instances via HTTP service on demand.

The following image shows how CloudSim works. A GameServer Launcher is reponsible for creating and closing the Unreal Eninge Pixel Streaming applications in the cluster. Each Unreal Eninge Pixel Streaming application is wrap as an Agones GameServer. A Pixel Streaming application is composed of three components, Unreal Engine application, WebRTC Proxy Server,  Signalling and Web Server.
