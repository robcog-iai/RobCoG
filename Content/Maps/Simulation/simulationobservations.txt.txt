first if both poured into and out events are not logged by robcog then ignore that experiment all togather.
Then only take those data values which has both events logged properly.
Ignore particles which are dropped out of containers due to failure in collision info.
Find out a way to detect colllision for each particile(so if there are total 10 particles then 10 contact events for cup as well as bowl should happen, intotal 20 contact events)
