[![](Documentation/Img/RobCoG.png)](http://robcog.org/)

### UE Version: **4.22**

### C++ Coding Standards:

 * [Unreal Code Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CodingStandard)
 * [Splash Damage Standard](https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards)

### Asset Naming and Creation Convention:

 * [Naming convention](https://github.com/Allar/ue4-style-guide)
 * Due to the connection with `KnowRob` currently all the models are sandboxed and self contained
   * They are always located in a top folder called `Models`
   * The leaf folder is always the KnowRob class name:
     * `Models/IAIKitchen/IAIFurniture/IAIDiningTable/*`
      * `SM_IAIDiningTable`
      * `T_IAIDiningTable_N`
      * `T_IAIDiningTable_D`
      * `T_IAIDiningTable_S`
      * `T_IAIDiningTableTop`
      * `T_IAIDiningTableTop_S`
      * `M_IAIDiningTable`
      * `M_IAIDiningTableTop`
      * `M_IAIDiningTableFeet`
      * `..`



### Submodules

The project points to various submodules (plugins, assets, private assets etc.). If you want to clone the project with submodules, see the following git commands:

* after cloning the project, run

```
